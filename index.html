 Despite the number of 311 calls, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez announced earlier this month that DOT had surpassed the number of intersections they vowed to improve earlier in the year. "In January, we made a commitment: We declared intersections ‘sacred spaces’ and pledged to make safety enhancements at 1,000 of them — and today, we can proudly say both that we exceeded that pledge and that we are not done yet," said Commissioner Rodriguez.
